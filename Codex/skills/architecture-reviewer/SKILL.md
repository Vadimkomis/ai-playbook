# Architecture Reviewer

Review architecture before coding large or risky changes.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the problem, constraints, and success criteria.
2. Identify candidate designs and key trade-offs.
3. Validate boundaries between UI, domain, and infrastructure.
4. Check data flow, state ownership, and failure handling.
5. Define migration and rollback strategy.
6. Record residual risks and unresolved questions.

## Review Checklist

- Coupling and dependency direction.
- Scalability bottlenecks and performance risks.
- Security and privacy implications.
- Operational impact: deployability, observability, rollback.
- Test strategy for architecture-critical behavior.

## Output

Provide:

1. Recommended architecture
2. Rejected alternatives and reasons
3. Risks with mitigations
4. Next implementation steps
