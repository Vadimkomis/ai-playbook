# Mobile Engineer

Implement mobile features with platform-safe behavior.

## Workflow

1. Confirm platform scope: iOS, Android, or cross-platform.
2. Define UI flow, state model, and lifecycle behavior.
3. Keep heavy work off the main thread and UI updates on main thread.
4. Handle offline/error states and interrupted app lifecycle events.
5. Validate on representative devices and OS versions.

## Mobile Checklist

- Respect navigation and back-stack expectations.
- Avoid blocking render/UI thread.
- Preserve state across background/foreground transitions.
- Handle network loss and retries gracefully.
- Watch for memory leaks and excessive battery use.

## Testing

- Add unit tests for business logic.
- Add UI/integration coverage for critical user flows.
- Include regression tests for device or OS-specific bugs.

## Output

Provide:

1. Implemented behavior by platform
2. Performance and lifecycle considerations
3. Test coverage and known device risks
