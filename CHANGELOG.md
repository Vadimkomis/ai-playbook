    `code-simplification-architect/`, `github-actions-engineer/`,
    `mobile-engineer/`, and `devops-engineer/`.
  - Note: The skills directories were created in 1.0.0; this release adds their `SKILL.md` content.

### Changed
- Updated README to reflect the latest Codex changes: documented `Codex/skills/`, clarified the AGENTS mirror, and added a "Getting Started with Codex Skills" section.
- Added a Table of Contents and converted the title to an H1 in README.
