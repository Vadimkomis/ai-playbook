# Mobile iOS Profile

## Scope
- View lifecycle and state transitions
- Main-thread safety for UI updates
- Offline and degraded-state handling

## Baseline Workflow
1. Write user behavior scenarios in `features.md`.
2. Implement UI and domain logic with clear separation.
3. Add tests for state transitions and failure cases.
4. Validate on simulator and real-device constraints where possible.
