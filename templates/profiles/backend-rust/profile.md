# Backend Rust Profile

## Scope
- Ownership-safe service boundaries
- Explicit error modeling with typed variants
- Throughput and latency-conscious implementation

## Baseline Workflow
1. Capture expected behavior in `features.md`.
2. Implement with clear domain modules.
3. Add unit and integration tests for happy and error paths.
4. Run checks for performance-sensitive paths before release.
