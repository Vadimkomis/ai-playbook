# Features

## Claude Code Integration

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| CLAUDE.md Macro | `completed` | Universal development guidelines symlinked to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — provides baseline rules for workflow, code organization, error handling, security, performance, testing, and documentation across all projects |
| Settings Configuration | `completed` | Permission controls (deny rules for secrets, destructive ops), status line, LSP plugins for Rust and Swift |
| Status Line Display | `completed` | Shows directory, git branch/status, Claude model, output style, and color-coded context window usage |
| Architecture Reviewer Agent | `completed` | Pre-implementation design validation — evaluates trade-offs, catches structural issues early |
| Senior Code Reviewer Agent | `completed` | Post-implementation review for bugs, security, performance, and maintainability using a 4-pass methodology |
| Senior QA Engineer Agent | `completed` | Test coverage analysis, test case design, TDD workflows, and flaky test debugging with auto-detected frameworks |
| Code Simplification Architect Agent | `completed` | Refactors messy code — simplifies nested logic, breaks down god classes, eliminates duplication |
| GitHub Actions Engineer Agent | `completed` | Creates, debugs, and optimizes CI/CD workflows with platform-specific caching and matrix strategies |

## Codex Integration

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| AGENTS.md | `completed` | Codex-compatible mirror of CLAUDE.md macro — same development standards adapted for Codex skills-based approach |
| Architecture Reviewer Skill | `completed` | Portable architecture review — clarify problem, evaluate designs, validate boundaries, define migration strategy |
| Senior Code Reviewer Skill | `completed` | Portable code review — inspect diffs, prioritize findings by severity (critical/high/medium/low), verify test coverage |
| Senior QA Engineer Skill | `completed` | Portable QA — build test matrices, analyze coverage gaps, triage flaky tests, assess release readiness |
| Code Simplification Architect Skill | `completed` | Portable refactoring — identify complexity hotspots, apply safe refactors, maintain behavior invariants |
| GitHub Actions Engineer Skill | `completed` | Portable CI/CD expertise — validate syntax, minimize permissions, improve speed, debug failures |
